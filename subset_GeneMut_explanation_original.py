# Context #
The eMIND is a text-mining system developed to extract information on the impact of variants on Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other relevant diseases. 
############
# Task #
You are given a table from eMIND with several columns. Your job is to verify if the mutation listed in Column 6 (in its normalized form) is mentioned in title and abstract in Column 21, and if this mutation is linked to the gene (in its normalized form) listed in Column 11.
############
#Criteria#
Mutation Matching: The mutation in Column 21 may be described differently than in Column 6. Recognize them as the same mutation, even if the names differ. For example, if Column 21 mentions "Arctic mutation" and Column 6 lists "p.Glu693Gly," these should be recognized as the same.
Gene Matching: The gene in Column 11 might not be explicitly named in Column 21. However, if Column 21 mentions a related subunit, receptor, or any alternative name that corresponds to the gene in Column 11, consider it a match.
Alternative Names and Symbols: Be aware that alternative names or symbols may be used for genes instead of normalized representation. Identify if they refer to the same gene.
Mutation IDs: If a mutation ID starting with "rs" is used, link it to the mutation name.
############
#Response#
Provide a simple "yes" or "no" answer.
Explain your reasoning for the answer.
Separate the answer and explanation by &&&.
